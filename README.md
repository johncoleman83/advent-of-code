# Advent of Code Solutions

This repo has my solutions for Advent of Code (AOC) written in Clojure

## Installation

URL: https://github.com/johncoleman83/aoc-solutions
Solutions compiled using Leiningen - https://leiningen.org/

## Usage

Run my code in your preferred IDE, or using Leiningen, type `-$ lein run #` into terminal.
NOTE: `#` refers to the "Day number" from AOC (e.g. `-$ lein run 3` will run day # 3 solution).
Code uses .txt files as input, the output will reveal solutions to AOC Problems.
