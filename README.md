# Advent of Code Solutions

This repo has my (David John Coleman II) solutions for Advent of Code (AOC) written in Clojure

## Installation

URL: https://github.com/johncoleman83/aoc-solutions<br />
Solutions compiled using Leiningen - https://leiningen.org/

## Usage

Run my code in your preferred IDE, or using Leiningen, type command `~ $ lein run #` into terminal.<br />
NOTE: `#` refers to the "Day number" from AOC (e.g. `~ $ lein run 3` will run day # 3 solution).<br />
Code uses .txt files as input, the output will reveal solutions to AOC Problems.
